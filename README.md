# Resource Links to Learn Software Development 
These are the best learning resources I've found to date.

Selection criteria - resource has at least one of the following aspects:
Either:
- **For absolute beginners:** Ease of understanding/accessibility
- **For professionals** fast upskill in a section
- **For growing intermediates/seniors** comprehensive learning.

Also:
- Where possible I lean towards **free** resources.

## Django:
#### Starting Out With Django:
* **The Official Django docs** and Django tutorial are great and very beginner-friendly! 
The Django site has all different levels of explanation, from a quick start to a tutorial to topic explanations to more in-depth and detailed documentation. They have links to the different section and an explanation of each [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/#how-the-documentation-is-organized).

    Format: **Official Docs** - But very user-friendly!

    Availability: **Free**


#### Getting Production-Ready: 
When you get comfortable enough with Django that you want to set up a production-ready (ie live) site you'll want to take a look at these:
* **Setting up a Postgres DB as your Django DB**: See this [guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-django-with-postgres-nginx-and-gunicorn-on-ubuntu-22-04).
